# worldcat

Set of Python scripts to establish how many times novels first published in the 19th and early 20th Century were reprinted in the period 1970-2009, based on data obtained from Worldcat. Note that Worldcat data is neither complete nor always reliable, so additional checks of the output are necessary.
